# Cost-Sensitive Deep Neural Networks (CSDNN)

Theano implementation of CSDNN proposed in [Cost-Aware Pre-Training for Multiclass Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning](http://people.csail.mit.edu/andyyuan/docs/ijcai-16.csdnn.paper.pdf), in *Proceedings of the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)*, 2016.
